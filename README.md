# ZombieBlaster - Unity - First Year

This is the first game I ever made in a public game engine, so yeah this is terrible but its here to stay XD

A Small zombies project I made for one of my first term modules at The University of Huddersfield.
I Like to keep this project online just to remind me how far I have came since I started university.
